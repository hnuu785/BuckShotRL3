Buckshot Roulette Game Logic Specifications

1. Game Overview
Type: Turn-based strategic game.
Players: 1 Player vs. 1 AI (Dealer).
Objective: Reduce the opponent's health (Charges) to zero.

2. The Shotgun (The Core Mechanic)
Magazine: A "load" consists of a randomized sequence of Live Rounds (Red) and Blank Rounds (Blue).
Transparency: At the start of each round, the player is shown the total count of Live and Blank rounds (e.g., "3 Live, 2 Blank").
Ordering: The rounds are shuffled and loaded into the shotgun in a hidden linear sequence (Queue).
Chambering: The shotgun fires one round at a time from the front of the queue.

3. Player Turn Actions
During their turn, the player must choose one of two primary actions:

A. Shoot Opponent (Dealer)
If Live: Dealer loses 1 HP. Turn ends.
If Blank: No damage. Turn ends.

B. Shoot Self
If Live: Player loses 1 HP. Turn ends.
If Blank: No damage. Player gains an extra turn (The most critical strategic element).

4. Item System & Detailed Rules
Items are granted at the start of a new magazine load (usually 2-4 items per player). Inventory limit is 8 slots.

Handcuffs (Skip Turn)
Effect: Skips the opponent's next turn.
Restriction: Cannot be used if the opponent is already handcuffed (is_handcuffed == true).
Special Case: If the player shoots themselves with a Live round while the opponent is handcuffed, the opponent's turn is skipped and it remains the player's turn.
Reset: The effect is consumed and reset to false after the opponent's turn is successfully skipped once.

Magnifying Glass (Peek Round)
Effect: Reveals whether the current round in the chamber is Live or Blank.
Usage: Informational only; does not end the turn.

Hand Saw (Double Damage)
Effect: Increases the damage of the current round to 2 (only if it is a Live round).
Restriction: Cannot be used if the gun is already in a sawed state (is_sawed == true).
Reset: The state is reset to false immediately after the round is fired or ejected via Beer.

Cigarette Pack (Heal)
Effect: Restores 1 HP to the user.
Restriction: Cannot exceed the maximum HP (Charges) defined at the start of the game.

Beer (Eject Round)
Effect: Ejects the current round from the chamber without firing it.
Side Effect: If the Hand Saw effect was active (is_sawed == true), it is neutralized and reset to false for the next round.

5. Game Flow Logic (State Machine)
Initialization: Set Max HP for both Player and Dealer.

Load Phase:
Generate a random mix of Live/Blank rounds.
Display the counts of each round type to the player.
Distribute random items to both parties up to the inventory limit.

Action Phase:
Check for active status effects (Handcuffs).
Await Input: Use Item, Shoot Opponent, or Shoot Self.
Resolve shot logic: Update HP and handle turn transitions.

Check Condition:
If Magazine is empty: Transition to Load Phase.
If HP <= 0: Trigger Game Over.
Else: Determine the next actor based on the previous action and status effects.

6. Complex Item Interaction Logic
Hand Saw + Beer: If a player uses the Hand Saw and then decides to use Beer, the sawed barrel effect is wasted. The round is ejected, and the is_sawed state returns to false for the next round in the chamber.
Hand Saw + Shoot Self: If is_sawed is active and the player shoots themselves with a Live round, they take 2 damage. If it is a Blank, no damage is taken, the turn continues, but the is_sawed effect is consumed and reset to false.
Handcuffs + Shoot Self (Blank): If the opponent is handcuffed and the player shoots themselves with a Blank, the player gets an extra turn as usual. The is_handcuffed state remains true because the opponent's turn has not yet been "skipped" (the player is still on their original/extended turn).
Handcuffs + Magazine Empty: If the is_handcuffed state is true but the last round of the magazine is fired or ejected, the Handcuffs effect persists into the next Load Phase. The opponent's first turn of the new magazine will be skipped.
